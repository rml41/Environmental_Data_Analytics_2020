## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Set your working directory

setwd("/Users/rmlandman/Desktop/Data Analytics/Environmental_Data_Analytics_2020/Project/EDA_2020_Project")
getwd()

# Load your packages

library(tidyverse)

# Set your ggplot theme

# Load your datasets

Ellerbee.Raw <- read.csv(../Data/Raw)

```
